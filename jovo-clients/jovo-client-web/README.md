## Introduction

![Jovo Client and Jovo Core Platform](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jovotech/jovo-framework/master/jovo-platforms/jovo-platform-core/img/jovo-client-platform-communication.png "How Jovo Core Platform communicates with clients like web apps")

[Jovo Clients](https://www.jovo.tech/marketplace/tag/clients) are used as a frontend that collects user input. This input (e.g. speech or text) is then passed to the [Jovo Core Platform](https://www.jovo.tech/marketplace/jovo-platform-core) that handles the conversational logic.

The "Jovo for Web" client can be used on websites and web apps. It comes with helpful features that make it easier to capture speech input, detect when a user stops speaking, and display information that is returned from the Jovo app. The client is open source and fully customizable.


### Installation

Install the client into your web project like this:

```sh
$ npm install jovo-client-web
