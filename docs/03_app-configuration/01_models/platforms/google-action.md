## Overview
The `googleAction` folder contains all the intents and entities needed for the dialogflow agent.

## Dialogflow
The Dialogflow API v1 does not support programmatic agent creation. Therefor you are not able to deploy the application using the Jovo CLI.  But you can use the CLI to create `zip` file, which you can then import into Dialogflow.

### Intents
Here you will find the intents, which were created using the Jovo interaction model. 

### Entities
The input types, which you created yourself, will be stored here.
